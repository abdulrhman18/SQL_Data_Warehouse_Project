# Data Warehouse & ETL Project

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a **Data Warehouse system using SQL**, including the development of a complete **ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline**.

The goal of this project is to transform raw operational data into a structured **analytical data warehouse** that supports **reporting, analytics, and business intelligence**.

The project follows modern **Data Engineering and Data Warehousing practices**, including:

- Data modeling
- Data cleaning and transformation
- ETL pipeline design
- Structured data loading
- Analytical data modeling

The final data warehouse is designed to make **business reporting and dashboard creation easier and more efficient**.

# 🏗️ Data Warehouse Architecture

The project follows the **Medallion Architecture** with three layers:

### 1️⃣ Bronze Layer – Raw Data
- Stores raw data exactly as received from source systems
- Data is loaded using **BULK INSERT**
- No transformations are applied
- Serves as the historical source of truth

### 2️⃣ Silver Layer – Cleaned & Transformed Data
- Performs **data cleaning and transformation**
- Fixes data quality issues
- Standardizes formats
- Applies business logic

### 3️⃣ Gold Layer – Business Data Model
- Contains the **analytical data model**
- Designed using **Star Schema**
- Includes **Fact and Dimension tables**
- Optimized for **reporting and dashboards**

### 📌 Folder Description

**datasets**  
Contains the raw datasets from different source systems:
- **crm** → Customer Relationship Management data  
- **erp** → Enterprise Resource Planning data  

**docs**  
Project documentation and architecture diagrams:
- Data architecture
- Data flow
- Data integration
- Naming conventions
- Data catalog

**scripts**  
All SQL scripts used to build and process the data warehouse.

- **bronze** → Raw data loading scripts  
- **silver** → Data cleaning and transformation scripts  
- **gold** → Analytical data model (fact & dimension tables)  
- **eda** → SQL queries used for exploratory data analysis and reports  

**init_database**  
Scripts used to initialize and configure the database.

**tests**  
Data quality validation scripts to ensure the integrity of the **Silver and Gold layers**.

If you want, I can also show you **how to add the architecture images in README so they appear visually on GitHub**, which makes the project **look much more professional for recruiters**.

# 🔄 ETL Pipeline

The ETL pipeline consists of three main stages:

## Extract
Data is extracted from multiple **source systems**:

- CRM system
- ERP system

The raw data is stored as **CSV files** and loaded into the **Bronze Layer**.

---

## Transform
In the **Silver Layer**, data is transformed by:

- Cleaning invalid records
- Handling missing values
- Standardizing data formats
- Removing duplicates
- Applying business logic

These transformations ensure **high data quality and consistency**.

---

## Load
The cleaned data is loaded into the **Gold Layer**, where:

- Fact tables store transactional data
- Dimension tables store descriptive attributes

This structure enables **fast analytical queries and business reporting**.

---

# ⭐ Data Model (Star Schema)

The final data warehouse uses a **Star Schema**, which is commonly used in **Business Intelligence systems**.

### Dimension Tables
- `dim_customers`
- `dim_products`
- `dim_dates`

### Fact Tables
- `fact_sales`

This design improves **query performance and simplifies analysis**.
